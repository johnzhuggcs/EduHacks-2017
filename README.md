SafeLearn (Placeholder name)

A crossplatform mobile app built using Java framework and PhoneGab that utilizes Google Maps functionality to optimize routes with the least amount of crime happened, primarily targetting students or parents of younger students who may have to walk to school.

Proposed Functionalities:
1. Using Google Maps library to calculate route from student's school address to their desired address (or vice versa), using City of Vancouver's weekly updated crime rate JSON datafile, algorithmically sort the suggested walking routes by lowest crime rates.

2. Also suggest routes based upon the number of lighting/street lamps.

3. Using Google Maps functionality and possibly crawling Wikipedia or other websites, provide educational facts of either landmarks or small environmental details along the suggested route. Aim to allow parents to engage their children along the way to/from school, or simply to curious older students.
